# Did I See It?
Did I See It? is a hobby project and successor to my previous project [Mediaful](https://github.com/cr4shed/Mediaful). The goal is to create a simple open source API to track movies and television shows watched across multiple services so nobody has to ask themselves if they have already seen it.

Current project goals include:
1. Implement the API.
2. Create a simple and fast web application for convenient usage.
3. Investigate using the API to support automatic updates from [Jellyfin](https://github.com/jellyfin).
4. Investigate other possible streaming service integrations likely by using browser extensions.
5. Investigate possible Smart TV integrations.
